IAEA Nuclear Licensing and Authorization Process

1. OVERVIEW OF LICENSING FRAMEWORK

1.1 Purpose of Licensing
Nuclear licensing ensures that nuclear facilities are designed, constructed, and operated safely.
The licensing process provides regulatory oversight throughout the facility lifecycle.
Licenses may be granted for site preparation, construction, commissioning, operation, and decommissioning.

1.2 Regulatory Body Requirements
The regulatory body must be independent of organizations promoting nuclear energy.
The regulatory body must have adequate resources, technical competence, and legal authority.
Transparency and public participation must be ensured in the licensing process.

2. LICENSE APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS

2.1 Preliminary Safety Information Document (PSID)
The PSID provides early safety information for regulatory review.
It includes site characterization, preliminary design description, and safety analysis.
The PSID supports early regulatory feedback before detailed design.

2.2 Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR)
The FSAR is the primary licensing document for nuclear facilities.
It must describe the facility design in sufficient detail for safety evaluation.
The FSAR must address:
- Site characteristics and natural hazards
- Design of safety-significant systems, structures and components
- Accident analysis including design basis and beyond design basis events
- Radiation protection program
- Emergency preparedness and response plans
- Radioactive waste management
- Security plans
- Operational limits and conditions

2.3 Environmental Impact Statement
An environmental impact statement must accompany license applications.
It must evaluate radiological and conventional environmental impacts.
Alternative sites and designs must be considered.

3. SAFETY REVIEW PROCESS

3.1 Completeness Review
The regulatory body first reviews the application for completeness.
All required information and analyses must be included.
Requests for additional information (RAIs) are issued for incomplete submissions.

3.2 Technical Safety Review
Safety reviewers evaluate the FSAR against applicable regulations and standards.
Reviews cover reactor physics, thermal hydraulics, structural analysis, and probabilistic risk assessment.
Independent calculations and analyses may be performed to verify applicant claims.

3.3 Inspection and Verification
On-site inspections verify conformance with license requirements.
Construction inspections verify material quality and fabrication standards.
Pre-operational testing verifies system performance prior to fuel loading.

4. PUBLIC PARTICIPATION

4.1 Public Hearings
Public hearings must be held for major licensing decisions.
Interested parties must have opportunity to submit comments and participate in hearings.
The regulatory body must consider and respond to substantive public comments.

4.2 Freedom of Information
Non-safeguards licensing documents must be publicly available.
The regulatory body must maintain a public document management system.
Security-sensitive information must be protected while maximizing public transparency.

5. LICENSE CONDITIONS AND ONGOING OVERSIGHT

5.1 License Conditions
Licenses include conditions specifying operational limits and surveillance requirements.
Conditions must be met throughout the life of the facility.
Violations of license conditions must be reported to the regulatory body.

5.2 Periodic Safety Reviews
Periodic safety reviews (PSRs) must be conducted every 10 years.
PSRs evaluate the cumulative effect of aging, modifications, and new safety information.
PSR findings may result in backfit requirements or license modifications.

5.3 License Renewal
Licenses may be renewed upon demonstration that adequate safety margins are maintained.
Aging management programs must be evaluated for license renewal.
Major modifications may require supplemental license applications.
