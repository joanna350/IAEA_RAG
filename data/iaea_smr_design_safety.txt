IAEA Safety Review for Small Modular Reactors (SMRs)

1. INTRODUCTION TO SMR SAFETY

1.1 Definition and Scope
Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) are defined as nuclear reactors with an equivalent electric power of up to 300 MW(e).
SMRs may be deployed as single or multi-module plants.
Multiple SMR designs exist including light water reactors, high temperature gas-cooled reactors, and molten salt reactors.

1.2 Safety Advantages of SMRs
SMRs incorporate passive safety systems that rely on natural forces such as gravity and natural convection.
Smaller core sizes reduce decay heat and improve passive cooling capabilities.
Factory fabrication improves manufacturing quality control.

2. LICENSING AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK

2.1 Design Certification
SMR designs must undergo comprehensive safety review by national regulatory authorities.
Design certification requires submission of a Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR).
The FSAR must address all safety-significant systems, structures, and components (SSCs).

2.2 Probabilistic Risk Assessment
A Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) must be performed for all SMR designs.
PRA must address internal events, external events, and seismic hazards.
Core damage frequency (CDF) targets: less than 1E-4 per reactor year.
Large early release frequency (LERF) targets: less than 1E-5 per reactor year.

2.3 Regulatory Review Process
Phase 1: Pre-application interactions and design review
Phase 2: Formal design certification application
Phase 3: Safety review and public comment period
Phase 4: Final safety evaluation report (SER) issuance

3. PASSIVE SAFETY SYSTEMS

3.1 Emergency Core Cooling Systems
Passive emergency core cooling must function without AC power or operator action.
Gravity-driven injection systems must provide adequate core cooling.
Natural circulation must remove decay heat for at least 72 hours without operator action.

3.2 Containment Design
Integral pressurized water reactor (iPWR) designs use integral containment structures.
Containment must withstand design basis accidents including loss of coolant accidents (LOCA).
Filtered containment venting systems must be provided for beyond design basis events.

4. SITING REQUIREMENTS

4.1 Site Evaluation
Site evaluation must assess geological, seismological, hydrological, and meteorological conditions.
Exclusion zone and low population zone requirements must be satisfied.
SMRs may allow smaller exclusion zones due to enhanced passive safety features.

4.2 Environmental Impact Assessment
Environmental impact assessment must evaluate radiological and non-radiological impacts.
Normal operation releases must comply with regulatory dose limits.
Accident scenarios must demonstrate acceptable off-site consequences.

5. OPERATIONAL SAFETY REQUIREMENTS

5.1 Technical Specifications
Limiting conditions for operation (LCOs) must be established for all safety systems.
Surveillance requirements must verify operability of safety systems.
Action levels must be defined for operation outside LCOs.

5.2 Human Factors Engineering
Control room design must incorporate human factors engineering principles.
Procedures must be developed for normal, abnormal, and emergency operations.
Operator training and qualification requirements must be established.
