IAEA Safety Fundamentals - Fundamental Safety Principles (SF-1)

1. SAFETY OBJECTIVE
The fundamental safety objective is to protect people and the environment from harmful effects of ionizing radiation.

1.1 Radiation Protection Principles
The use of nuclear energy and radiation sources must be justified. The benefits must outweigh the risks.
Radiation doses must be optimized to be as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA).
Individual doses must not exceed established dose limits.

2. SAFETY PRINCIPLES FOR NUCLEAR INSTALLATIONS

2.1 Responsibility for Safety
The prime responsibility for safety must rest with the person or organization responsible for facilities and activities.

2.2 Role of Government
An effective governmental framework for safety must be established and sustained.
This includes an independent regulatory body with legal authority to regulate nuclear facilities.

2.3 Leadership and Management for Safety
Effective leadership and management for safety must be established and sustained in organizations concerned with nuclear energy.

3. DESIGN AND ASSESSMENT OF FACILITIES

3.1 Defence in Depth
A defence in depth approach must be applied to nuclear installations.
Multiple independent barriers between radioactive materials and workers and the public must be established.

3.2 Safety Assessment
Comprehensive and systematic safety assessments must be carried out before construction and operation of nuclear installations.
Regular safety reviews must be conducted throughout the lifetime of the facility.

4. EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE

4.1 Emergency Plans
Arrangements must be made for emergency preparedness and response for nuclear or radiological emergencies.
On-site and off-site emergency plans must be developed and exercised.

4.2 Protective Actions
Criteria and procedures for protective actions must be established.
Evacuation zones and shelter-in-place protocols must be defined.

5. RADIOACTIVE WASTE MANAGEMENT

5.1 Waste Minimization
The generation of radioactive waste must be kept to the minimum practicable.
Radioactive waste must be managed in a manner that ensures acceptable levels of safety.

5.2 Long-term Safety
The safety of future generations must be ensured through proper disposal of radioactive waste.
Geological repositories must demonstrate long-term safety for thousands of years.
